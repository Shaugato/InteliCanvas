PHASE 0 — Scaffold a single-port full-stack app in Replit (Web app template) using Vue.

Goal:
One Replit project that runs:
- Node server (TypeScript, Express, ws)
- Vue client (Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript)
- ONLY ONE externally exposed port (the Node server)
- Server listens on 0.0.0.0 and port = process.env.PORT || 3000
- Dev mode: Node is the only server bound to the external port; it mounts Vite in middleware mode (no separate Vite port)
- Prod mode: server serves /client/dist static assets

CRITICAL: NO REACT
- Do NOT use React anywhere.
- If any existing React files/dependencies exist in this repl (react, react-dom, @vitejs/plugin-react, JSX/TSX), remove them.
- Ensure the client is a Vue project (createApp + App.vue).

Create folders:
- /client (Vue 3 + TS + Vite)
- /server (Node + TS + Express + ws)
- /shared (TS types shared by both)

Hard rules:
- Do NOT create a second server that listens on another port.
- Do NOT put any API keys in the client.
- Read secrets from process.env only (server-side).

Server requirements:
- GET /api/health -> { ok: true }
- WebSocket endpoint /ws:
  - When server receives JSON { "type": "ping" } it responds with { "type": "pong" }
- Bind to 0.0.0.0 and use process.env.PORT
- In dev, use Vite middlewareMode so the Node server serves the client through the same port
- In prod, serve static files from /client/dist and fallback to index.html

Client UI requirements - in a creative way:
- Show “Canvas loading…”
- Show WebSocket status: connected/disconnected
- Button “Send ping” that sends {type:"ping"} over WS
- Display last received message (should show pong)

Root scripts:
- npm run dev -> starts server in dev mode (Vite middleware included)
- npm run build -> builds shared + client + server
- npm start -> runs production server serving built client

Replit config:
- Add a .replit file with run = "npm run dev" (or ensure Run triggers npm run dev)

Deliverables:
- A working monorepo or workspace setup (npm workspaces preferred)
- README with:
  - How to run in Replit
  - Required env vars (GEMINI_API_KEY, APP_ENV, PUBLIC_BASE_URL)
  - Note: secrets must be set in Replit Secrets, not in code
- Verify Vue wiring:
  - client/package.json includes "vue" and "@vitejs/plugin-vue"
  - client/package.json does NOT include react/react-dom/@vitejs/plugin-react
Stop after it works in Replit webview.

Definition of Done (must verify):
- Replit Run opens webview successfully
- /api/health returns {"ok": true}
- WebSocket connects and ping/pong works from the UI
